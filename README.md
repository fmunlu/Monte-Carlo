# Monte-Carlo

### A1 -- European Call and Put Option Pricing
Calculation of prices of European call and put options using Black-Scholes formula and the Monte Carlo method. In addition, we illustrate the effect of
samplt size to the standard error.

### B1 -- Pricing of Asian Options
Calculation of prices of geometric Asian options using Black-Scholes formula and their estimation via Monte Carlo method. In addition, we estimate
prices of arithmetic Asian options for which a closed form analytic formula does not exist.

### M1 -- Integral of the Brownian Motion wrt Time
We prove the fact that the integral of the standard Brownian motion with repect to time is a normal random variable and calculate its mean and variance using 
Fubini's Theorem; and empirically verify it by generating paths for the Brownian motion.
